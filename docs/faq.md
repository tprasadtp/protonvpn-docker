## Run container as systemd unit

- Use `podman` instead of docker as it has better support for systemd.
- You can run `protonwire` container as usual and the generate systemd unit for it via,

    ```bash
    podman generate systemd \
        --new \
        --name protonwire \
        --after network-online.target
    ```
    > See [podman-generate-systemd][] for more info.

## Why can't you auto-magically select a server like from older versions

- This is caused by API changed on server side.
- To do that it requires authenticating via proton account username and password and we want to avoid that(there are no scoped tokens and minted access tokens have full access to proton API including payments and Email!!).
- Because fastest server selection depends on geo-location and latency info, it can no longer be supported.

## Can I have a sample API response JSON

Below is **sample** data for endpoint `/v1/server/{name}`.
ExitIPs are calculated to account for proton's internal routing.
Exit IPs of Nodes with same DNS and public key are pooled together to build the list.
It might not be accurate because sometimes ProtonAPI will give you a public IP address
which does not show up in the API responses altogether.

## How to check if systemd-resolved is in use

- If you are using Ubuntu/Fedora with defaults you are most likely using systemd-resolved for local DNS.
- Run `resolvectl status --no-pager`. If it has `resolv.conf mode: stub`.  you are using `systemd-resolved`.

## What with route table 51820

- We keep WireGuard route table separate (`51820`).
- By default we _include_ following subnets to be routed over VPN
    - `10.2.0.1/32` (_DNS server_)
    - `0.0.0.0/5`
    - `8.0.0.0/7`
    - `11.0.0.0/8`
    - `12.0.0.0/6`
    - `16.0.0.0/4`
    - `32.0.0.0/3`
    - `64.0.0.0/3`
    - `96.0.0.0/6`
    - `100.0.0.0/10`
    - `100.128.0.0/9`
    - `101.0.0.0/8`
    - `102.0.0.0/7`
    - `104.0.0.0/5`
    - `112.0.0.0/5`
    - `120.0.0.0/6`
    - `124.0.0.0/7`
    - `126.0.0.0/8`
    - `128.0.0.0/3`
    - `160.0.0.0/5`
    - `168.0.0.0/8`
    - `169.0.0.0/9`
    - `169.128.0.0/10`
    - `169.192.0.0/11`
    - `169.224.0.0/12`
    - `169.240.0.0/13`
    - `169.248.0.0/14`
    - `169.252.0.0/15`
    - `169.255.0.0/16`
    - `170.0.0.0/7`
    - `172.0.0.0/12`
    - `172.32.0.0/11`
    - `172.64.0.0/10`
    - `172.128.0.0/9`

    - `192.0.0.0/9`
    - `192.128.0.0/11`
    - `192.160.0.0/13`
    - `192.169.0.0/16`
    - `192.170.0.0/15`
    - `192.172.0.0/14`
    - `192.176.0.0/12`
    - `192.192.0.0/10`
    - `193.0.0.0/8`
    - `194.0.0.0/7`
    - `196.0.0.0/6`
    - `200.0.0.0/5`
    - `208.0.0.0/4`
    - `224.0.1.0/24`
    - `224.0.2.0/23`
    - `224.0.4.0/22`
    - `224.0.8.0/21`
    - `224.0.16.0/20`
    - `224.0.32.0/19`
    - `224.0.64.0/18`

    - `224.8.0.0/13`
    - `224.16.0.0/12`
    - `224.32.0.0/11`
    - `224.64.0.0/10`
    - `224.128.0.0/9`

    - `228.0.0.0/6`
    - `232.0.0.0/5`
    - `240.0.0.0/4`
- For IPV6 we _include_ `2000::/3` as it excludes almost all _reserved_ addresses.

## NAT and KeepAlive packets

WireGuard is not a chatty protocol. However for _most_ if not all use cases, end user devices are using some form of NAT via docker, Kubernetes, home router or some other means. So _Keep alive_ is enabled and set to 20 seconds which should be enough for almost all NAT firewalls.

## Split horizon DNS

- This is only possible with `systemd-resolved`. After connecting to VPN (`protonwire connect`) You can verify split dns configuration via `resolvectl query <domain>` and check the interface being used to resolve it.
Please ensure to use stub resolver mode as many statically built programs (Especially go/rust programs) do not use `nss-resolve` and directly read `/etc/resolv.conf`.
- Please ensure that your DHCP server/router or VPN gateway advertises search domains. They will be automatically picked up if using NetworkManager(most desktops) or `systemd-networkd` (most servers) or `ifupdown`.

## Running systemd unit as non-root user

- Unit **MUST** have `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability
- Unit **MUST NOT** run as DynamicUser
- Unit **MUST NOT** use `RemoveIPC=yes`
- You **MUST** use `systemd-resolved` for DNS
- If using `systemd-resolved`, polkit rules **MUST** allow unit's user to invoke to following D-Bus actions
    - `org.freedesktop.resolve1.set-dns-servers`
    - `org.freedesktop.resolve1.set-domains`
    - `org.freedesktop.resolve1.set-default-route`
    - `org.freedesktop.resolve1.revert`
    - `org.freedesktop.resolve1.set-dnssec`

## Use with corporate/other VPN

- If other VPN routes only private subnets you don't need to do anything! It just works! Just make sure there search domain/routing domains are set on your corporate/other VPN interface (`resolvectl domain`) so that DNS queries for those domains will be resolved correctly.

## How can I see WireGuard settings

```bash
wg show
```

## Non reachable LAN hosts

Following addresses on local network or other VPNs **cannot** be reached when ProtonVPN is active. This is the way ProtonVPN is setup on server side and **CANNOT** be changed!
Also these addresses cannot belong to machine running protonwire.
- 10.2.0.1 (used by server and as DNS server)
- 10.2.0.2 (used by client)

## IP check endpoints

You can use any of the following services for verification as they return your _public_ IP address.
  * https://icanhazip.com/
  * https://api.ipify.org/
  * https://checkip.amazonaws.com/

## Metadata updates

Metadata updates includes updating server IPs and their public keys.
Usually it should be automatic. But Proton API and libraries are in constant state of ~~chaos~~ flux
and documentation is virtually non-existent or incorrect. So stuff might break.
PRs welcome! Bulk of the work is done via `scripts/generate-server-metadata`
